                <p class="pAboutMe">My name is Sharith Valbuena Florez, I am eighteen years old and I am just starting my life as a programmer. I have intermediate knowledge in JavaScript and Java programming languages and as for technologies I know HTML5 and CSS3. I have managed tools such as Jira, GitHub, Slack, Git Bash and XAMPP.</p>
                <p class="pAboutMe">At this moment of my life I am doing a technologist on Information Systems Analysis and Development or as many know it, Software Programming. In all this process I have learned a lot and although at first I did not want or understand anything about this world, now little by little every day I learn more and I like it.</p>
                <p class="pAboutMe">My hobbies are summarized in reading, listening to music, studying and practicing my English, since my first language is Spanish, every day I have to reinforce my English and also practice programming.</p>
                <p class="pAboutMe">My life is summarized in a little bit of daily life and tranquility.</p>

            <div class="skills1">
                <p class="pSkills">One of my most outstanding skills is knowing how to work in a team, I have always tried to learn good things about each person I work with, always trying to be a person who knows and respects to listen to others. By listening to others and their ideas, I am always willing to learn every day but as long as they are positive things for my personal and work life.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skills2">
                <p class="pSkills">Something very essential in my life is respect. In my house for as long as I can remember we have always treated each other with respect; without getting carried away by the bad attitudes of others and with respect you can always get somewhere.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skills3">
                <p class="pSkills">Another very important value for me is responsibility, although many times I have had problems in leaving things half done, I have always tried to be responsible with my duties and responsibilities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skills4">
                <p class="pSkills">As for my technical skills, it hasn't been easy but I've always tried to learn, research and not go unproven. I have been improving my ability with logic, since logic is super important in this career and little by little I have been improving it, on the other hand my Frontend skills have also been improving.</p>
